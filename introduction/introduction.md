# Introduction to Dynamsoft Barcode Reader

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) enables you to embed barcode reading capabilities with enterprise-class performance in your web, mobile, desktop or server applications using just a few lines of code.

## Features

### High performance

DBR is carefully designed to provide a good balance of performance between speed, read rate and accuracy when reading barcodes.

### Multi-code recognition

DBR can read multiple barcodes of different barcode formats at once.

### Powerful customizability

DBR offers hundreds of custom settings that allow fine-tuning of the entire recognition process to achieve optimal performance for specific usage scenarios.

## Supported Barcode Formats

As of version 9.0, DBR supports the following barcode formats:

## Enhancements

### Intermediate Results

DBR returns intermediate results used or generated during the recognition process. These results include raw images, pre-detected regions of interest, preprocessed images, binary images, text regions, contours, and line segments, etc. These results can help speed up other workflows that might need to extract similar information from images.

### Data Matrix Direct Part Marking

DBR supports decoding DPM Data Matrix codes (often used in the automotive, aerospace and electronics manufacturing industries) that are difficult to read due to possible surface defects, poor lighting conditions, and similar colors and contrasts.

### Vector PDF File

DBR can read barcodes in vector PDF files more efficiently than raster PDF files because it can process vectors directly in PDF files, which means no time is wasted on image processing.

### Panorama

DBR-based Dynamsoft Panoramaâ„¢ is a revolutionary inventory management solution that captures images and stitches them together into a complete panoramic view, allowing workers to view detections results in real-time and spot any missed barcodes.
