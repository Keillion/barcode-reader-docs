## Can I scan barcodes on US Driver’s Licenses and get the first name, last name, DOB, etc.?

Yes you can a US driver's license to get the details. The best way to do so is to follow our pre-built driver license sample for the JavaScript edition, which can be found in the [code gallery](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/resources/code-gallery/?SampleID=619). This sample can also be found in the `samples\4.use-case` folder of the JavaScript package download (via the Dynamsoft website).
