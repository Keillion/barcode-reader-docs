## After one year the annual license expires and I don't renew it in time, what will happen?

Your users will be met with a message saying that the license has expired when they try to use the application that is using the Barcode Reader. In order to renew the license immediately, you can do so via the [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/fullLicense) or by contacting the [Dynamsoft Support Team](https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact/).
