# DBR Introduction

## How do I get a free trial of the SDK? How many days does the free trial allow? Can I extend my trial if I need more time? If so, how?

To get a free trial of the SDK, please read through this [section of the user guide](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/programming/javascript/user-guide/?ver=latest#requesting-a-trial).
The main way is via the [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense) through which the customer can also extend their trial once their original expires. The trial can be extended twice, for 15 days each, and a total of 30 days.
