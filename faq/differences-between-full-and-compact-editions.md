## What are the differences between the compact edition and the full edition?

The main difference between the two is the set of supported barcode formats.
**Compact edition** supports `1D`, `QR`, `PDF417`, and `Datamatrix` (the most popular barcode formats), while the **full edition** supports the complete set of Dynamsoft Barcode Readerâ€™s supported barcode formats.
Furthermore, the full edition supports the following features while the compact does not: `getIntermediateResults`, `initRuntimeSettingsWithString`, and ` outputSettingsToString`.
